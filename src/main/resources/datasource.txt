how to implement dynamic datasource with Spring Framework?
In order to implement a dynamic datasource with the Spring Framework, you would need to do the following:

Create a DataSource bean that can be dynamically changed at runtime. This can be done by using the javax.sql.DataSource interface and creating a custom implementation that wraps a target DataSource.

Create a DataSourceLookup bean that can be used to determine the target DataSource based on some criteria, such as the current user or a thread-local variable. This can be done by implementing the org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.lookup.DataSourceLookup interface.

Configure the dynamic DataSource bean to use the DataSourceLookup bean to determine the target DataSource.

Use the dynamic DataSource bean in your DAO classes or services by injecting it into the class using the @Autowired annotation.

In runtime, use the DataSourceLookup to determine the target DataSource based on your criteria and set it in the dynamic DataSource bean.

Note: The above is a general idea, the actual implementation will differ based on the version of Spring Framework you are using and your specific use case.

Another way to implement a dynamic datasource with Spring Framework is by using the AbstractRoutingDataSource class. This class allows you to define a map of DataSource instances, where the key is a lookup key that you can use to determine the target DataSource at runtime. Here's a general outline of how you can use this class:

Create a custom implementation of the AbstractRoutingDataSource class that overrides the determineCurrentLookupKey() method. This method should return the lookup key that corresponds to the target DataSource.

In your configuration class, define a bean for the custom routing DataSource and a bean for each of the target DataSource instances.

In your custom routing DataSource bean, use the setTargetDataSources() method to set the map of DataSource instances.

Use the custom routing DataSource bean in your DAO classes or services by injecting it into the class using the @Autowired annotation.

In runtime, use the determineCurrentLookupKey method to determine the target DataSource based on your criteria.

Additionally, you can use a DataSourceSelector by implementing your custom DataSourceSelector and configure it in your configuration class, then use setDataSourceSelector method to set the DataSourceSelector.

Again, the actual implementation will depend on the version of Spring Framework you are using and your specific use case.

Another way to implement a dynamic datasource with Spring Framework is by using the Spring's JNDI support. This approach allows you to configure your datasources in an external JNDI context, such as an application server, and then look them up at runtime using JNDI names. Here's an outline of how you can use this approach:

Configure your datasources in an external JNDI context, such as an application server. Make sure to give each datasource a unique JNDI name.

In your Spring configuration, define a JndiObjectFactoryBean for each datasource.

In your custom routing DataSource bean, use the setTargetDataSources() method to set the map of JndiObjectFactoryBean instances, where the key is the JNDI name of the datasource and the value is the JndiObjectFactoryBean instance.

Use the custom routing DataSource bean in your DAO classes or services by injecting it into the class using the @Autowired annotation.

In runtime, use the determineCurrentLookupKey method to determine the JNDI name of the target DataSource based on your criteria.

Please note that JNDI setup is different based on the Application Server you are using.

Again, the actual implementation will depend on the version of Spring Framework you are using and your specific use case.

Another way to implement dynamic datasource with Spring Framework is by using a third-party library such as spring-jdbc-dynamic-datasource which provides a pluggable way to switch between multiple DataSources. Here's an outline of how you can use this library:

Add the spring-jdbc-dynamic-datasource library as a dependency to your project.

Create a DataSource implementation that wraps the spring-jdbc-dynamic-datasource library's DynamicDataSource class.

Configure multiple DataSource beans in your Spring configuration, and register them with the DynamicDataSource.

In runtime, use the DynamicDataSource's setDataSourceLookup(DataSourceLookup) method to switch between DataSources based on your criteria.

Use the DynamicDataSource in your DAO classes or services by injecting it into the class using the @Autowired annotation.

Please note that this library is not officially supported by Spring Framework and you may need to test and debug it based on your specific use case and version of Spring Framework.

Again, the actual implementation will depend on the version of Spring Framework you are using and your specific use case.

Another way to implement dynamic datasource with Spring Framework is by using the Spring's feature called Profile. A profile is a way to have different beans configurations based on the environment. For example, you could have different configurations for your application when it's running in development and production environment. Here's an outline of how you can use this approach:

Create multiple DataSource beans, one for each environment.

Use the @Profile annotation to specify which environment the DataSource beans should be used.

In your Spring configuration, define a DataSource bean and use @Profile annotation to specify which environments it should be used.

Use the spring.profiles.active property to specify the active profile in runtime.

Use the DataSource bean in your DAO classes or services by injecting it into the class using the @Autowired annotation.

In runtime, Spring will automatically choose the correct DataSource bean based on the active profile.

Please note that this approach would not allow you to switch DataSources at runtime, but rather at application startup. Also, this approach would only work if you have different environments, for example, development and production.

Again, the actual implementation will depend on the version of Spring Framework you are using and your specific use case.

Another approach to implement dynamic datasource with Spring Framework is by creating a DataSource configuration class that holds a map of all available data sources, and a method to switch between them. Here's an outline of how you can use this approach:

Create a DataSource configuration class that holds a map of all the available DataSources, where the key is the DataSource name and the value is the DataSource instance.

Create a method in the configuration class that allows you to switch the current DataSource by setting the current DataSource name in a thread-local variable.

Create a custom DataSource implementation that retrieves the current DataSource name from the thread-local variable and returns the corresponding DataSource instance from the map.

In your DAO classes or services, use the custom DataSource implementation to access the database.

In runtime, use the method in the configuration class to switch between the DataSources based on your criteria.

This approach allows you to switch between DataSources at runtime and doesn't require any additional libraries. However, it can be complex to implement and manage, especially if you have many DataSources or if you need to switch DataSources frequently.

Again, the actual implementation will depend on the version of Spring Framework you are using and your specific use case.
